# Things I Would Like To Do

- [x] Replace rotate_l/r with just >> whenever possible
- [x] Improve the evaluation function for position
- [x] Fix the move generation by filtering only for legal moves (i.e. king safety)
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of alpha-beta pruning by ordering the moves before searching
- [x] Implement a user input so people can play against the machine
- [ ] Improve documentation for ease of use and understandability
- [x] Compute the evaluation of moves in quasi-parallel
